## About: 
Developed code from scratch to compute an input probability query on a given Bayes net on discrete random variables using Prior sampling, Rejection Sampling, Likelihood weighting and Gibbs sampling. <br>
We had also written helper function to generate samples from any input univariate discrete distribution and then use it in your Bayes Net sampling code.

<br>

## BayesNets Class:
We implemented a BayesNets Class to do all the required task and computations.<br>
Basically we created a single class to do all the calculation, extractions of details from the file as well as implement all the sampling methods and sample generation.

## To Get The Better Understanding of the Assignment Please go through the `Jupyter File` named [Bayes_Nets_Assignment.ipynb](Bayes_Nets_Assignment.ipynb).

<br>

### The `Python File` named [bayesNets.py](bayesNets.py) contains the class only, But the `Jupyter File` named [Bayes_Nets_Assignment.ipynb](Bayes_Nets_Assignment.ipynb) contains the class as well as many more features and functionalities.
